# Writing-First-Python-Code
My Introduction to Python using Jupyter

This was my first interaction coding with Python using Jupyter Notebook.  This came from a course on Coursera called the "IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate" and specifically the class was called "Python for Data Science, AI & Development."  I start with the basic printing of "Hello, Python!" and then go on to learning about comments, errors, objects, expressions, and variables.
